# SkyTrack-Precision-Airline-Data-Pipeline-
SkyFlow is a scalable ETL pipeline for processing airline data efficiently. Built with Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy) and MySQL, it automates data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and storage. With optimized indexing, logging, and monitoring, SkyFlow ensures fast querying, high data integrity, and seamless integration for large-scale analytics.

✈️ ElevateAir: Intelligent Airline Data Pipeline 🚀
Project Vision 🌍
ElevateAir is a high-performance ETL pipeline designed to extract, refine, and store airline data in a MySQL database, empowering data-driven insights in Tableau. Built with Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy) and executed in Jupyter Notebook, this pipeline ensures seamless data transformation for real-time airline analytics.

Tech Stack 🛠️
Python (pandas, SQLAlchemy, pymysql)

MySQL Database (for structured data storage)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive execution)

Tableau (for advanced visual analytics)

GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

MySQL Workbench (optional, for direct database inspection)

ETL Logging (real-time execution tracking in etl_monitoring.log)

ETL Workflow 🔄
🛬 1️⃣ Data Extraction
Airline records are ingested from CSV files into a pandas DataFrame.

The extracted data is securely stored in a MySQL database.

✨ 2️⃣ Data Transformation
The dataset undergoes comprehensive SQL-based enhancements, including:

Data Purification: Eliminating inconsistencies, null values, and redundant entries.

Passenger Segmentation: Categorizing travelers into Children, Teens, Adults, and Seniors for demographic insights.

Temporal Aggregation: Structuring flight statistics by month to detect seasonal patterns.

Data Harmonization: Standardizing formats and ensuring cross-table consistency.

🔎 Sample SQL Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age >= 60 THEN 'Senior'
        WHEN age >= 18 THEN 'Adult'
        WHEN age >= 13 THEN 'Teen'
        ELSE 'Child'
    END AS passenger_category,
    COUNT(*) AS flight_count
FROM airline_data_refined
GROUP BY passenger_category;
🛫 3️⃣ Data Loading
The enriched dataset is stored in MySQL within the airline_data_refined table.

Data is seamlessly integrated into Tableau for live analytics and visualization.

Tableau Intelligence Dashboard 📊
The Tableau dashboard unveils hidden patterns through interactive data storytelling, featuring:
✅ Flight frequency distribution across passenger age groups.
✅ Month-over-month airline performance trends.
✅ Key operational metrics for data-driven decision-making.
